- the `2017` data is in `buildings_data_17.csv`

- You will have to preprocess the data in order for it to play nicely with the feedback tables. Because of this, I have taken a sample of the larger dataset and padded the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` fields to 6 decimal places. You can find these tweleve data sets zipped in `months`. 

- the original City of Chicago data can be found here, at the Data Portal: https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/inspect/svcs/building_violationsonline.html
