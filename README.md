# IBM Continuous Learning Blog Post Companion Materials
Companion data and preprocessing notebook for the IBM WDP blog post. 
IBMers can access the blog on the w3 IBM Watson Data Platform blog [here](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/blogs/2aebb2ff-a9d6-4523-a34a-dbc2c5e7d872/entry/Continuous_Learning_on_Watson_Data_Platform?lang=en_us). 


- the `2017` data is in `buildings_data_17.csv`

- You will have to preprocess the data in order for it to play nicely with the feedback tables. Because of this, I have taken a sample of the larger dataset and padded the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` fields to 6 decimal places. You can find these tweleve data sets zipped in `months` where we have preprocessed them already. 

- the original City of Chicago data can be found here, at the Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Violations/22u3-xenr
